La solution propose une intégration avec des systèmes tiers : Yes, through API.

Elle offre un système de plugins : No.

Possibilité d'ajouter du code personnalisé : Possible.

**Points forts** : It's super complete, TONS of things to use and build pratically anything with it. Great for fast iteration and buqiness applications dev

**Points faibles** : You can't transfert the ownership of things on cloud environment. So you have to use your client env. directly. Also, learning curbe is huge. Think of it like learning all AWS services.
