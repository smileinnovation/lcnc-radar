MuleSoft is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Seems to be really easy to compose automation and has a dedicated app (easier to deploy at scale on big corpo)

**Weaknesses**: Salesforce ecosystem. No information about the pricing. Client has to be installer, no sign of web interface.
