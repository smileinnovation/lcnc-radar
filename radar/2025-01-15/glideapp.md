Glideapp is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Super short time to marlet, we're talking about days only. Big component library for quick reusability. Marketplace opportunity

**Weaknesses**: Breaking change in the editor can happen from day to another. Will not break the running app but still need to rework the app before new deploy. Can only deploy on their stack. Cannot be exported. Subject to huge price change in the past.
