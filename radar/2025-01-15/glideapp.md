La solution propose une intégration avec des systèmes tiers : yes, through API.

Elle offre un système de plugins : Several native integration..

Possibilité d'ajouter du code personnalisé : Possible but limited.

**Points forts** : Super short time to marlet, we're talking about days only. Big component library for quick reusability. Marketplace opportunity

**Points faibles** : Breaking change in the editor can happen from day to another. Will not break the running app but still need to rework the app before new deploy. Can only deploy on their stack. Cannot be exported. Subject to huge price change in the past.
