Webflow is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Easy to use, code can be exported to host somewhere else or in the event of stopping using the service. Only forms and CMS api will not work outside, but CMS collections can be exported as well

**Weaknesses**: While anyone can use it, people will still need to have some basic training on accessibility, web design, etc.
