La solution propose une intégration avec des systèmes tiers : Yes, possible to integrate code.

Elle offre un système de plugins : A lot, and can use code.

Possibilité d'ajouter du code personnalisé : Possible.

**Points forts** : Easy to use, code can be exported to host somewhere else or in the event of stopping using the service. Only forms and CMS api will not work outside, but CMS collections can be exported as well

**Points faibles** : While anyone can use it, people will still need to have some basic training on accessibility, web design, etc.
