Plasmic is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Seems really easy to use, code is open-source so we can install on the client stack for free if we want. Generated code can we deploy wherever we want.
