Squarespace is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Really easy to use, tons of templates, selling tools from complete ecommerce solution to just some modules adapted to your need. Reseller options. Marketplace to distribute plugin and / or theme.

**Weaknesses**: Close ecosystem. Limited portability except the HTML/CSS/JS code. Plugings will not work out of the system.
