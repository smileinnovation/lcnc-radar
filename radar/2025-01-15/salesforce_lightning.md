Salesforce Lightning is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Great to build inside Salesforces ecosystem, apps or automations. Either custom solution for a client or something more generic that can be sold to several of them (editor strategy)

**Weaknesses**: Limited to Salesforce ecosystem. The opportunity for a company like Smile, without adopting a position of editor, seems either limited (by opportunity) or a brand new position to assume.
