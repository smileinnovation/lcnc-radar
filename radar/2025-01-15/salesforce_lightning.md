La solution propose une intégration avec des systèmes tiers : Yes, through API.

Elle offre un système de plugins : Several native integration..

Possibilité d'ajouter du code personnalisé : Possible.

**Points forts** : Great to build inside Salesforces ecosystem, apps or automations. Either custom solution for a client or something more generic that can be sold to several of them (editor strategy)

**Points faibles** : Limited to Salesforce ecosystem. The opportunity for a company like Smile, without adopting a position of editor, seems either limited (by opportunity) or a brand new position to assume.
