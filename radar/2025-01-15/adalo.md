Adalo is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: A serious challenger of Glide apps. Probably more appropriate if you're distributing public mobile app. Let you publish on the app store

**Weaknesses**: Can't get the code out if you want to outgrow the solution. Pricing is a bit complicated.
