ManyChat is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Impressive references like Nike. The tool does a few things but does it right. They have a 50% comission and an angecy program.

**Weaknesses**: More focussed on marketing automation and lead generation.
