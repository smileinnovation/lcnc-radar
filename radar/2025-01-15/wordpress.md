WordPress is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: It's the #1 PHP CMS that powerd more than half of the PHP website on the planet. It's free to use, can sell services around it all we want. Great for ecommerce with WooCommerce suite.

**Weaknesses**: The last couple of weeks / months were difficult with very controversial position from the founder. Incertaint future. A hard fork might be on the table soon. Difficult to find appropriate plugin when a need is defined
