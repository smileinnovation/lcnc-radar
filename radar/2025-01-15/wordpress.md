La solution propose une intégration avec des systèmes tiers : Yes..

Elle offre un système de plugins : Tons. Integrated marketplace.

Possibilité d'ajouter du code personnalisé : Possible.

**Points forts** : It's the #1 PHP CMS that powerd more than half of the PHP website on the planet. It's free to use, can sell services around it all we want. Great for ecommerce with WooCommerce suite.

**Points faibles** : The last couple of weeks / months were difficult with very controversial position from the founder. Incertaint future. A hard fork might be on the table soon. Difficult to find appropriate plugin when a need is defined
