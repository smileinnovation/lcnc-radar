Odoo is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: Huge modularity, known technology at Smile, great opportunity in terms of project size and very important community. Strong relationship with the editor.

**Weaknesses**: Difficult to find appropriate plugin when a need is defined. Performance issues on very big volume of entities (> rmillions).
