La solution propose une intégration avec des systèmes tiers : yes, through API.

Elle offre un système de plugins : A lot, entire marketplace around this.

**Points forts** : The leader of out-of-the-box ready e-commerce solution. Partner program. Great tool and support

**Points faibles** : Really different to our core business logic. Either we can become a "partner" as solution designer that works with Shopify or do custom integration for client (front or back, business logic or external system).
