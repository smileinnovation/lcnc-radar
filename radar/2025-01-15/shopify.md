Shopify is a low-code / no-code solution designed to accelerate application development or manage content efficiently. It enables both technical and business teams to design, integrate, and deploy digital solutions with modular capabilities.

**Strengths**: The leader of out-of-the-box ready e-commerce solution. Partner program. Great tool and support

**Weaknesses**: Really different to our core business logic. Either we can become a "partner" as solution designer that works with Shopify or do custom integration for client (front or back, business logic or external system).
