# About this Technology Radar

### Introduction

This radar is a curated exploration of the evolving landscape of low-code and no-code (LCNC) platforms. It is designed as a strategic tool to help teams at Smile — and potentially beyond — understand which technologies are gaining traction, which are worth exploring, and which should be handled with caution.

The radar synthesizes both technical and strategic insights across a wide range of LCNC tools. It reflects ongoing evaluations, based on factors like integration capabilities, customization, business models, and the potential for added value in professional contexts. Particular attention is paid to the needs of developers, business teams, and innovation stakeholders seeking fast iteration, efficient prototyping, or operational gains.

### Quadrants

We categorize technologies across four main quadrants:

- **No-Code Platforms and Builders**: Tools that allow building applications without writing any code. Often focused on business users or citizen developers.
- **Low-Code Platforms and Rapid Application Development**: Platforms requiring minimal code, aimed at developers or tech-savvy users building production-grade apps.
- **Low-Code Related Open Source Solutions**: Community-driven or hybrid solutions offering flexibility and extensibility with minimal lock-in.
- **Automation and Integration**: Tools focused on workflow automation, data synchronization, and system integration.

### Rings

Each technology is assigned to a ring that reflects its maturity and relevance for our current context:

- **Adopt**: Technologies we confidently recommend for use.
- **Trial**: Promising technologies worth testing on real use cases.
- **Assess**: Tools to explore and evaluate in targeted experiments.
- **Hold**: Technologies that are not recommended at this stage, either due to risk, lack of fit, or better alternatives.

### How this Radar is Built

The radar combines desk research, expert feedback, internal testing, and scoring based on multiple criteria (including integration ease, extensibility, lock-in, licensing, and Smile-specific opportunity). Tags and structured metadata allow filtering and cross-comparing solutions.

This radar is also a living document — continuously refined as new solutions emerge and organizational needs evolve.

### Contributing

This radar is developed by the innovation team at Smile. Contributions and suggestions are welcome via pull requests or issues on the internal repository. If you’re part of Smile and would like to propose a new tool, share your experience, or contribute evaluations, feel free to reach out.
